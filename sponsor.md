After a final display of LinkDN to Mr. Eckman, he is very satisfied with the final result. He also mentioned additional features we could add in the future if we continued to work on our site: A portfolio creator for students interested in the arts, a page on how to start/create a club, and a calendar that includes holiday breaks. While our team had ideas for an Eckman Easter Egg, we chose not to include it as one of the project requirements was to not include distracting features for the Sponsor theme. He is satisfied with the resume tools and grade calculator with various features. He is also intruiged by database work although not entirely knowledgeable on the topic of roles and authentication to fully understand each line of code. 

## "I am proud of your team's creation and it was exactly how I imagined to look like. This would be a cool idea to further develop for school use and we could  change the current way people connect with each other in schools. Overall great job!!" - Mr. Eckman
