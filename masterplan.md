## Implementing Mortensen Feedback:
 * Grade Calculator:
   * comments: Make a requirement tracker (similar to STUDENTVUE) which can incorporate parts of privacy and security
   * Can make two separate pages and add lots of graphics with bars for percentages??
 * Resume creator:
   * Comments: Similar to Linkedn, but make it more specific to high school students
   * Can potentially use polymorphism
   * Can possibly automate with the profile by transfering info from profile to resume (need to save info to profiles)
